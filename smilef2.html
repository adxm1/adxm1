    <h1>Oldtimer1's Smile — F2 Open Pollination</h1>
  </header>
  <section class="entry">
    <p>In case you were unaware, Oldtimer was a UK grower seed collector and breeder with a love of sativas and a very high level of intelligence. He worked for decades, since at least the 1970s. He produced several strains for release in around Around 2010ish. Smile is his most indica plant but retains, in his words, the 'sativa spirit'. These are the last f1 Smile seeds I have. Hopefully I'll be able to retain all the plants in open pollination, to preserve as much genetic diversity as possible from this small number. Already you the can see the quality in the germination and subsequent vigour. Smile is Celia x Camden Poison.</p>
    <p><i>"Celia is an Oldtimer1 clone-only mother line, and mother to the much revered seed line Smile. Celia started life as a Haze x Skunk called HL (Or in the words of ot1 “Was it HD?”), the genetics of which come from a time that predates their introduction to Holland, and from a time when the handle meant what they did, rather than a particular type. A later cross by Mr Soul, made using a brother to the infamous Princess (but was never marketed, as it grew too tall) was used to pollinate HL creating what we know as Celia. Oldtimer1 crossed Celia to Camden Poison, a squat fast flowering indica dominant hybrid variety bred in North London, and released Smile in 2008 to much acclaim amongst UK growers."</i></p>
    <p>I started 14 seeds, 13 germinated and very quickly too. These seeds were 15 years old.</p>
    <p>1st picture around 2 days from soaking the seeds, 21st July. In Plant Magic compost with their mycorrhiza Granules, watered through with Plant Magic Veg Boost prior to planting.</p>

    <p>This is August 2nd plants about 12 days old, first soil feed today 2ml Oldtimer grow and .25 mil Ecothrive Flourish (seaweed) per litre, followed by 1ml Plant Magic Silicon on day 13.</p>

    <p>August 8th aged 18 days, now under more light 315w CMH in Horizon relector and 2x 220w LED, dimmed. Roughly 550w light. Foliar fed Ecothrive Flourish, and later sprayed with Skram, an organic bug detterent, as a precaution.</p>

    <p>August 10th, veg day 20. 2nd proper feed 2.5ml OT Grow and .25ml Ecothrive Trace, followed by 1.5ml Silicon on day 21. Switched from 24 hour light to 18 on 6 off. I did this to encourage presexing. </p>
