    <h1>Oldtimer1's Smile — F2 Open Pollination</h1>
  </header>
  <section class="entry">
    <p>Welcome! I started 14 Smile F1 seeds, 13 germinated. Seeds were 15 years old. I will post updates here.</p>
    <p>Oldtimer was a UK grower seed collector and breeder with a love of sativas and a very high level of intelligence. He worked for decades, from when only a very few people gkobally knew it was even possible to grow good cannabis indoorsa. in England and produced several strains for release. Smile is his most indica plant but retains, in his words, the 'sativa spirit'. I bought Smile Oldtimes C3 and Smellberry around 2009-11. These are the last f1 Smile seeds I have. Hopefully I'll be able to retain all the plants in open pollination, to preserve as much genetic diversity as possible from this small number. Already you can see extraordinary vigour and germination rate still in the seed. Space is limited so it will be interesting if nothing else! </p>
    <p>1st picture around 2 days from soaking the seeds, 21st July. In Plant Magic compost with their Myco granules, watered through with 'veg boost'prior to planting.</p>

    <p>August 8th aged 18 days, now under more light 315w CMH in Horizon relector and 2x 220w LED, dimmed. Foliar fed Ecothrive seaweed, and later sprayed with Skram, an organic bug detterent, as a precaution.' </p>

    <p>August 10th, veg day 20. 2nd proper feed 2.5ml OT Grow and .25ml Ecothrive trace, followed by 1.5ml silicon on day 21. Switched from 24 hour ligt to 18 on 6 off. I did this to encourage presexing. </p>
